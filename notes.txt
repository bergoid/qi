pager.vim
---------

v F to follow
v ctrl-c to stop following
v q to quit
. handle (color) escape sequences
    --> use AnsiEsc.vim
. show messages in grey reversed to indicate follow/no-follow

================================================================================
. qi script
    . meant to be sourced?
        . contains bash functions

    . or to be run?
        . takes command name as 1st argument

. Run 'qi' at command line
    . if inside tmux session: abort
    . 'tmux list-sessions' is run to check for existing 'qi[0-9]*' sessions
    . a new tmux session 'qi<N>' is created (and attached to)
    . Two L/R panes are created
    . In the L pane: vim is launched (no underlying bash?)
        --> remap 'quit' keybindings (like ZZ, ZQ, C-F12, A-F12, ...) to only close file without quitting vim
        --> new keybinding to quit vim
    . In the R pane: bash terminal
    . Optional argument: file to be opened by vim in L pane

. Run 'qi' by piping input into it:
    . example: some_command | qi
    . if not inside tmux session:
        . create new qi tmux session
        . tail output of some_command in R pane
    . if inside non-qi tmux session: abort
    . if inside other 'qi[0-9]*' session:
        . tail output of some_command in R pane

. qi commands:
    create : create 2-pane tmux session
        --> needed? wouldn't this be the default action without arguments?

    run : run a given command, pipe the output to a logfile and tail that file in the R pane. The following commands will make use of 'run':

    buildfile : compile 1 file
    build : Walk up dir path given as argument. As soon as a makefile is found: make
    buildall : Walk up dir path given as argument. If a makefile is found, store its path in a variable. Overwrite this value every time. Continue until root dir. Run make on makefile in variable.

    cleanfile
    clean
    cleanall


. 2 tmux panes
    . L : vim
    . R : less +F ~/log/latest.txt
    --> name them E(dit) & O(utput)? Position on screen configurable.
        3rd pane C(ommand)

. auto-reload file in vim:
    :h autoread

. vim async features:
    :h timer_start
    :h channel

. things needed along with qi:
    . rabot
    . vim as pager
    . babs

    not necessary:
        . preppy
        . vim plugins
